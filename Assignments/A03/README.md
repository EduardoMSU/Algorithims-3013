|  1  |  [Link 1](Main.cpp)  |  Main.cpp is where everything gets put together and gets the final touches to be able to give ouput  |

### Instructions:

- If it is a leaf node it can just be deleted and be made null. 
- If the parent node has one child node the delete the parent node and let the child node replace it.
- If the parent has two child nodes then let either the pre successor or the post successor take it's place.
